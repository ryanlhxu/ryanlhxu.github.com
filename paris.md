I apologise for my rudeness a few weeks ago. While I'm glad to be one of your friends, losing your cell number indeed made me sad. 

<br/>

I hope that you can improve your English perpetually and have all the materials related to the exam kept in mind. Hold on to your dream, though you might experience some very tough days. It deserves. 

<br/>

Finally, I had better remind you that this page is named "paris" and not public, therefore, nobody would know it unless I told him/her the url.
